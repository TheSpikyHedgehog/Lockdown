# Known Bugs/Glitches/Exploits

- Wall phase bug.

Almost impossible to recreate but is still there.  

- Wall teleport/speed run **bug/glitch/exploit**

As the creator, I do know exactly how to recreate this bug/glitch/exploit and I am trying my best to fix it.  So far, I have only made it harder to pull off but the bug is still very much there and isn't too hard to replicate.  This is mainly because of the way of how I implemented "solid objects".  It wasn't the best way to create "solid" objects but I couldn't think or search of any other better solution.  The speed can "build up" and teleport or make you move very fast allowing you to escape the entire map or to move to a different place very quickly.
