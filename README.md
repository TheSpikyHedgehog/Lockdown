# Known Bugs/Glitches/Exploits

- Wall phase bug.

Almost impossible to recreate but is still there.  

- Wall teleport/speed run **bug/glitch/exploit**

As the creator, I do know exactly how to recreate this bug/glitch/exploit and I am trying my best to fix it.  So far, I have only made it harder to pull off but the bug is still very much there and isn't too hard to replicate.
